Welcome to Hellheim.

It is a first person narrative action game where you are a proud and arrogant Viking who is on trial trapped in Hellheim
where he encounters a series of tests and where he finds his ancestors trapped in search of reaching Valhalla.
Will he manage to ascend or will he stay in that hell forever?

Game designed in 48 hours by only 1 person. I couldn't finish the combat mechanics...but I hope you enjoy it.

Thanks for playing, I really hope you like it.
